	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1> 
	
	<br><b>Where are your recipes from?</b>
	<br>We write our own after testing them on our families, and we partner with select bloggers to integrate their recipes.  We keep our 30 minutes or less promise, so we are choosey about recipes.  Recipes have to be main dishes that finish in 30 min including prep time.  We favor recipes that are easy to make and contain plenty of vegetable content.  Occasionally you will find recipes that take slightly longer.  That's because the dish tastes so good it would be a shame not to include it.  Often the extra time is only waiting time.  Find out more about our on-staff writing team in <a href="/home/about_us">About Us</a>.  Or click on the author attribution information directly in the recipe.

	<br><b>I know I want pizza tonight, how do I search pizza recipes directly? </b>
	<br>Our philosophy is discovery based rather than search based.  But you can influence the results.  On the discovery page, look near the top edge of the screen for "I want".  Type in "pizza" next to it and click on the right-arrow at the right edge of the screen.  You should start discovering pizza recipes.
