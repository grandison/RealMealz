	<h1>About Us</h1> 
	<p> 
		Are you too busy to plan dinner?  We are too.  That's why we built RealMealz to quickly discover 30 minute meals using ingredients we already bought.  This way, we eat well, and the food we bought doesn't go to waste.  Sometimes, the food pictures inspire us to plan ahead a few meals too.  Discover for yourself how RealMealz can help you cook more and eat better.  It certainly helped us and our families do the same.

	How are we different from Epicurious and cooks.com?</div></b>
		<ol>
		<li>We streamline for everyday homecooking. We focus on main-dish recipes made in 30 minutes or less.  No fuss. Just fast, tasty and homemade.  </li>
		<li>We recommend rather than make you search: you don't have to know what you want to use us.  Tell us what's in your fridge and we'll give you some ideas.  We show you pictures to inspire your appetite. </li>
		<li>We let you filter according to your preferences.  Tell us what you are avoiding and you won't see a recipe you can't eat. </li>

				A good meal always lifts my spirits.  And eating well fuels my body to do everything else: such as building a career in Product Management, earning an MBA and building RealMealz.  I enjoy cooking, but I get tired of making my usuals and don't have time to search for new recipes.  Most days I can't spare more than 30 minutes to cook. That's why RealMealz was born to 1) use up my ingredients in delicious ways, and 2) keep my meals organized so I can focus on the rest of my life.  I believe that with a little help, people will discover the ease and benefits of homemade over fast and frozen foods. So I have assembled a passionate team to create the knowledge and tools to let everyone enjoy the bounty of our lands, one homemade meal at a time.<br><br></td>

				<br>
				My friends call me a serial entrepreneur since I'm always building a software startup (this will be my fourth).  As such, I almost never have time to cook a good meal. I "plan" when I'm already hungry and want to eat moments after I step into the kitchen.  
				It's always a challenge to find something interesting to cook in that moment, especially since my family is gluten free.  I could just stop building software startups so that I'll have time to cook, but what's the fun in that?  
				Instead, I'm building RealMealz so that all the busy people out there like me will be able to eat healthier and tastier home cooked food without resorting to repeating the same dishes over and over again.<br><br>

				<br>
				I am a foodie by association. Before I met my fianc√©e Kim, I considered burrito with sour cream a fancy meal. Thanks to her, I have learned to appreciate the finer things things of the edible world.  We just returned from several years of traveling in developing countries where we were exposed to a simpler way of living. The experience inspired us to make almost all our food at home now. Whether it is freshly baked bread, homemade granola, or even an ugly Kombucha mother fermenting on our counter, there is always something new happening in the kitchen. RealMealz has given me an opportunity to put my programming skills towards something I truly believe in, and help others discover there is more to life than just burritos...even with sour cream.</td>

				<br>
				I've worked for over 15 years in commercial kitchens, helping companies like Bon Appetit and Hyatt Hotels develop menus that are cost effective, fast enough to deal with the lunch rush, and both healthy and tasty.  
				Ever wonder how you can order at a restaurant and get your food in under 10 minutes while it takes you an hour to cook at home?  Are the cooks in a commercial kitchen somehow moving at 
				super speed, a wok in each hand while chopping with their foot? Of course not. I've taught hundreds of normal people, just like you to cook in a commercial setting, and there's no reason 
				that you can't cook like that too.  I love to cook, and I want everyone to learn that with a little training, advanced preparation, and a few tools that RealMealz provides, you can cook 
				simple, healthy, and tasty meals in under 30 minutes. <br><br>

				 I blog about what I cook and where I eat.  I LOVE food. I'm always looking for new recipes, reading cookbooks, watching Gordon Ramsay's TV shows, watching all types of cooking tutorials on youtube, and spending loads of time at the grocery store. I live with my brother and a kitten (Meatball) in Toronto.  Going into 4th year of Graphic Design at OCADU.<br><br>

				<br>
				 I have been cooking for 35 years and been testing recipes on my very well fed husband and daughter.  My first kitchen was my own and not my mom's.  I did not enter the kitchen until I was well over 18.  So I learned everything on my own and through some cooking classes I attended early on.  It is all about experimentation and the courage to try, plus a forgiving family to eat your concoctions.  But don't be discouraged, get feedback, and keep trying.  Because eating well keeps the family healthy, and a healthy family is worth all the time spent in the kitchen.  Besides, you can always recruit your kids to be your sous chefs and turn the experience into family time.<br><br>
