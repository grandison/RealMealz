				<blockquote><i>"We've been looking for a food-based wellness challenge and RealMealz delivered the perfect solution!  Our employees had a great time at the kick-off with a RealMealz healthy cooking demo (which they got to participate in) and a delicious lunch. RealMealz rallied our wellness teams to cook healthy meals in 30 minutes or less. The RealMealz website is fantastic â€“ what a great concept!"</i> -Megan @ Practice Fusion </blockquote>
			Show your employees you care about their health by challenging them to a RealMealz Cooking Challenge.  Award prizes to employees or employee-teams who hit a 700 point goal for cooking regularly and taking charge of their food health. It will build comraderie, create fun in the workplace and make you a champ!   Who wouldn't enjoy tasty food, especially when it takes less than 30 minutes to make and is good for health?  We can set up your group on RealMealz.com so you can create teams, engage employees, see leaderboards and track team points for as low as $2 per employee.  We also offer kick-off cooking demos and lunch parties.  Please fill out the form below if you're interested and we'll be in touch!
