1/4 cup fresh organic lime juice

1/4 cup organic olive oil

**instructions**

1. Toast the quinoa in a dry skillet over medium heat until it has a nutty aroma. Remove from heat, rinse and drain in a fine mesh strainer. Bring water to a boil in a saucepan, add salt, and slowly add toasted quinoa. Cook until tender and the outer rings appear on the grains, 15 to 20 minutes. Strain through a fine mesh colander. Place in a large bowl to cool.

2. In a small bowl, combine apples, lime juice, olive oil, honey, garlic, sunflower seeds, mint, shallot, and arugula. Stir into the cooled quinoa and add salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.   Toss in fresh arugula.
