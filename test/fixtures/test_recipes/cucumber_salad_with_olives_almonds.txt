Why this recipe works:
We started our Cucumber Salad recipe by selecting American cucumbers, which are crunchier than their English cousins. Draining the thinly sliced cucumbers on paper towels helped to wick away some of their moisture, and using some of the remaining liquid in the dressing gave it more fresh cucumber flavor. Our Cucumber Salad recipeâ€™s dressing used a base of vinegar, which we simmered to preserve its character and mellow its sharp bite.
